# TMDB-Box-Office-Prediction
Movies are an integral part of our entertainment life and the makers are always very concerned about the earnings of movie based on various factors. So there is a need for prediction system to make good predictions about the revenue.

# Problem Statement
1. Movies are an integral part of entertainment for all humans in the world. 
2. There is a huge pressure of revenue generation when movies are released.  
3. Having an interface where we can predict the revenue generated by movie which helps to directors, producers, investors to take appropriate decision.
4. We will be building up a model which predicts revenue based on various factors(discussed ahead). 

# Dataset
1. We have 2 sets of file: Train and Test Dataset
   A. Training Dataset Shape: (3000,23)
   B. Testing Dataset shape: (4398,22)

2. Attributes: Id, Collection, Budget, Genres, Homepage, Imdb_Id, Language, Title, Overview, Popularity, Poster, Prod Companies, Prod Countries, Release date, Runtime, Status, Tagline, Keywords, cast, Crew, Revenue.

# Approach
1. Univariate Analysis
2. Visualization
3. Outlier Treatment
4. Feature Engineering
5. Feature Selection
6. One Hot Encoding
7. Model Building: MLR and Random Forest
8. Model Validation and Accuracy
9. Creation of Pickle File
